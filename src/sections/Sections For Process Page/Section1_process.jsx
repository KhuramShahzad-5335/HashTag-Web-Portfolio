            Crafting Application's Wireframes
          </h3>
          <p className="p_1">
            While we're well-versed in project specifications and equipped with communication tools like Slack, Skype, and Basecamp, 
            the question remains: How long does it take to build an app? The design phase, known for its complexity in mobile app creation, 
            leads us to the very first step: wireframing.
          </p>
          <p className="p_1">
            Let's consider a chat feature within the app. An app can boast numerous functionalities, including single chat, group chat, 
            and timeline administration. Wireframing serves as a powerful tool to clearly depict this specific requirement, granting 
            stakeholders a precise visualization of the chat's functionality and flow.
